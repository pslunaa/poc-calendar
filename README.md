# Next Leap üöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ

The project that's one small step for developers, one giant _leapüöÄ_ for Loomi.

## Introduction

At Loomi we are always experimenting new technologies, libraries, architectures and so on. This makes our projects always a total surprise, and that's awesome, but when the number of projects starts to grow, it becomes more difficult to maintain.

So we decided to create an example project that implements the best tools we use to build robust, scalable and production ready applications.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a collection of good practices when developing React applications. It is supposed to showcase solving most of the real-world problems of an application in a practical way and help developers writing better applications.

Feel free to explore the codebase to get the most value out of the repo.

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and be consistent with your style.
